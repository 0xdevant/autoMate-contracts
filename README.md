## AutoMate - Hookathon Project for Uniswap Hook Incubator(UHI)

This project is submitted as the Capstone Project to apply for the 1st Cohort of the UHI program's Hookathon.

AutoMate is a general-purpose hook to let users subscribe to a service running by a network of decentralized keepers(a.k.a. the swappers) for automatic execution of on-chain tasks. Keepers are incentivized by swapping at a favorable price curve adjusted dynamically via Dutch Auction to help subscribers execute any on-chain tasks in a trustless way.

## Contract Structure

AutoMate mainly consists of two contracts:

`AutoMate.sol` - The Hub that handles all the subscriptions and executions of on-chain tasks.

`AutoMateHook.sol` - The Uniswap v4 Hook that implements the custom price curve w/ Dutch auction to incentivize keepers to execute tasks.

## Usage

### Build

```shell
$ forge build
```

### Test

```shell
$ forge test
```

## Future Improvements

1. A frontend to allow task subscription and displaying the dynamic price curve with a swap UI
2. Apply gas simulation and security check to the calldata users passed in while subscribing tasks to prevent spam/malicious task subscription
3. Allow hooks to accept a looser interval (allow tasks to be scheduled per 2hr, 4day, 3weekâ€¦)
4. Automatically compound the fees taken from users' subscription into discounted pools as liquidity to smoothen the balance between Token A and Token B

## References

This idea was first thought of integrating with Eigen Layer's AVS, but it becomes more economically viable thanks to the inspiration from [UniBrain Hook](https://hackmd.io/@kames/unibrain-hook).
