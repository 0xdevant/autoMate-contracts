## AutoMate

A general-purpose hook to let user subscribe to a decentralized keeper service to help execute on-chain tasks automatically. Essentially the hook uses automated Dutch Auction to customize the price curve to incentive "rational economic actors" to help execute any on-chain tasks that require scheduling in a trustless way. Our demo use case would be a DCA task.
